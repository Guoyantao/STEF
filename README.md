# stFeatures

 Hi, welcome to stFeatures package.  stFeatures means "space-time features", a space-time change detection algorithm for monitoring forest disturbances from satellite image time series. The algorithm identify potential forest disturbances as "extreme events" in local data cubes of satellite observations, and extract several space-time features from the local data cube. With training data,  the space-time features are used to discriminate real forest disturbances from false detection. The algorithm is developed for near real-time forest change monitoring, but it can also be used to map historcal forest disturbances.
