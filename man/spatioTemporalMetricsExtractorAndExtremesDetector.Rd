\usage{
stef_monitor(inraster, my_dates, mYear,
  spatiaNormPercentile, threshold, densityPlot, windowwidth, tryCatchError,
  sPatioNormalixse, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{inraster}{Input raster stack. Note that this input is literally the a local spac-time data cube whose dimensions are defined by the user.}

\item{my_dates}{A vector containing the acquisition date for each image/layer in the image stack.}

\item{mYear}{The  start datetime for the minotoring period. This parameter has to be defined either as a decimal year (e.g. 2015.356)
if the start of the monitoring period is not at the begining of the year or as a integer year (e.g. 2015) if the monitoring period start at the begining of the year.}

\item{spatiaNormPercentile}{The upper percentile ( e.g. 95 percentile ) for determining the value to use
to spatially normalise the values in the local data cube. Spatial normalisation is done to reduce seasonal variation in the data cube
and also to reduce inter-sensor differences in the time series (data cube) when using multi-sensor time series.}

\item{threshold}{A percentile/ extremeness for determining if the observation being monitored (typically newly acquired observation) is an extreme. Typically the value should be below 5th percentile}

\item{densityPlot}{Logical. If TRUE, for every pixel in the entire raster stack, the observations in the local data cube would be plotted as density function when detecting deforestation.}

\item{windowwidth}{A numeric value specifying the spatial extent (deminsions) of the data cube. The data cube always has a square spatial extent, hence one numeric value as input, and
the windowwidth can only be defined as an odd number,larger than 1}

\item{tryCatchError}{Logical. If TRUE, pixels were the algorithm faces an error during  processing would be ignored, and NA values would be return for each of such pixel. If FALSE, the process would stop.}

\item{sPatioNormalixse}{Logical. If TRUE, pixel values at each timestep will be normalised spatially using  spatiaNormPercentile value, and normalisation wil be local (within the data cube)}
}
\value{
Returns a vector containing (1) the timing of a forest cover disturbance (the datetime of the image in which the disturbance is detected),(2) number of observations in the reference cube (period),
(3) the standard deviation of the observations in the reference cube, (4) the actual threshold value corresponding to the percentile specified as 'threshold", (5) the magnitude of change (the difference between the actual threshold and the extreme observation ,
(6) the number of consecutive extremes (can either be 2 for confirmed disturbance  or 1 if extreme observation is only occuring in the last image of the time series),
(7) the number of neigbouring pixels (8-connected neigbours) whose observations are also qualifying as extremes at a time step before the central pixel experiences extreme event, (8) whether there are some neigbouring pixels (8-connected neigbours) whose observations are also qualifying as extremes at a time step before the central
 pixel experiences extreme event at the next time step  (this is either 1 for yes or 0 for No), (9) the number of neigbouring pixels (8-connected neigbours) whose observations are also qualifying as extremes at the same time step the central pixel is experiencing the extreme event,
 (10) whether there are some neigbouring pixels (8-connected neigbours) whose observations are also qualifying as extremes at the time step the central
 pixel is experiencing extreme event (this is also either 1 for yes or 0 for No), (11) whether are some of the  8-connected neigbours masked as non-forest based on th forest mask, (12) and the number of those 8-connected neigbours masked as non-forest.

\description{
This function detects extreme events (observations) at sub-annual scales in the space-time data cubes of satellite images.
Extreme observations are identified at pixel level, and the extremeness is defined based on percentile (e.g 5th percentile). The observations in the data cube are normalised spatially to reduce seasonality, a procedure carried out within this function, if specified, otherwise it is assumed that data have been normlised already.
The function is intended for near real-time deforestation monitoring using satellite image time series.It is scalable to multiple cores (See usage example).
NOTE: This function must always be called within the \code{\link[spatial.tools]{rasterEngine}} function. See the usage example
